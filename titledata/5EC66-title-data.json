We may also provide access to your Personal Information to protect our rights and property and those of our agents, users, and others, including to enforce our agreements, policies, and our Terms of Service. For example, we may use your Personal Information to respond to inappropriate or reported conduct in-Game, to enforce user bans for the Game and the Game Discord channel, and for moderation and enforcement of Discord channel policies.\\n\\n* In connection with a sale or other transfer of our business: In the event all or some of our assets are sold, assigned, or transferred to or acquired by another company due to a sale, merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, financing, bankruptcy, or otherwise, your Personal Information may be among the transferred assets.\\n\\n* As we may describe to you when collecting your Personal Information: There may be other situations when we collect your Personal Information and simultaneously describe the purpose for that collection. \\n\\nLawful Basis \\n\\nWe only collect, use, or store your Personal Information for a lawful basis such as: \\n\\n* you voluntarily provide it to us with your specific, informed, and unambiguous consent (for example, through the Game Discord channel); \\n* it is necessary to provide you with a Service that you have requested (for example, providing you access to the Game);\\n* we have a legitimate business interest that is not outweighed by your privacy rights (for example, to ban users); or  \\n* it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of others (for example, we may collect or share Personal Information where necessary to resolve an urgent medical situation or protect the health or safety of one of our users or someone else).\\n\\n7. In what situations do we disclose your Personal Information?\\n\\nWe may disclose your Personal Information to a third party, such as a service provider or contractor for a business or operational purpose, or with your consent. When we disclose Personal Information for a business or operational purpose, we enter into a contract with the service provider or contractor that describes the purpose and requires the service provider or contractor to both keep that Personal Information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.

How is my Personal Information protected?\\n\\nOur Retention, Purpose Limitation, and Security Policies\\n\\nWe protect your Personal Information through a combination of collection, security, and retention policies.\\n\\n* Limited retention: We retain each category of Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Information was provided to us or, if longer, to comply with any legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce contracts. For example, we may retain Personal Information collected about you to prevent repeated violations or suspected violations of our Terms of Service if your account has been banned or your access to the Services has been disabled for any reason. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information, the purposes for which we process the Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. For example, subject to the foregoing considerations, it is our policy to delete your Personal Information if we stop operating the Game or feature through which the Personal Information was acquired.\\n\\n* Purpose limitation: We will use your Personal Information only for the Services you choose to access and for the purposes notified to you, unless we otherwise obtain your consent. We limit the collection of Personal Information to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary for those purposes.  \\n\\n* Security measures: We use appropriate measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the volume and nature of Personal Information processed and risk involved, considering the size, scope, and type of our business, and have implemented contractual, technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. As part of our privacy compliance processes, we review these security procedures on an ongoing basis to consider new technology and methods as necessary. However, please understand that our implementation of security measures as described in this Notice does not guarantee the security of your Personal Information. In the event of a security breach, we will notify the proper regulatory authorities and any affected users of the breach within 72 hours after we become aware of the breach.\\n\\nYour Practices and Activities\\n\\nYour practices and activities are likewise very important for the protection of your Personal Information. You can take certain steps to help protect your Personal Information, such as being mindful of what you share publicly in the Game or on the Game Discord channel, including the below. \\n\\n* Do not use your real name when selecting a username.\\n\\n* Do not share your real name or anything private about yourself or anyone else with other users of the Game or Game Discord channel.\\n\\n* Do not pick a password that is easy to guess, and do not share your password.  \\n\\nPlease remember that we have no control over what third parties do with the content of your communications and no responsibility or obligation regarding third parties.\\n\\n9. How do we treat Personal Information transferred to the United States?\\n\\nPlace of Business\\n\\nWe may store or process your Personal Information outside of the country where we collect the information or the country in which you reside. Our primary place of business is in the United States. You should understand that we may transfer some or all of your Personal Information to the United States to carry out certain operational and processing needs as described in this Notice.\\n\\nTransfer Mechanisms\\n\\nWhen transferring Personal Information out of foreign territories, we implement technical, organizational, and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Information. We use European Commission approved standard contractual clauses and implement related measures where required by applicable law. Please contact us if you have questions related to the relevant transfer mechanism for your Personal Information.\\n\\n10. What rights do you have to your Personal Information?\\n\\nRight to Access, Correct, Delete, or Restrict Processing\\n\\nSubject to any limitations and exceptions under applicable law, you have the right to request access to your Personal Information and exercise the below rights.  \\n\\n* You have the right to correct or update certain types of Personal Information.

For example, we are not required to delete your Personal Information if we have an overriding legitimate ground for retaining that information, such as to prevent fraud. Please note that we are legally prohibited from carrying out requested actions in some instances, including (1) when we are unable to confirm your identity or (2) where doing so would adversely affect the rights or freedoms of other individuals.  Further, we are not required to carry out a requested action in some instances, including where the request is considered excessive.\\n\\nWe are Here to Help\\n\\nPlease complete a support ticket at https://support.gorillatagvr.com/ or email us at support@anotheraxiom.com with the subject line \\u201CPrivacy Request\\u201D if you would like to exercise any of the rights described above or if you have questions regarding your rights. \\n\\n11.

In what situations do we disclose your Personal Information?\\n\\nWe may disclose your Personal Information to a third party, such as a service provider or contractor for a business or operational purpose, or with your consent. When we disclose Personal Information for a business or operational purpose, we enter into a contract with the service provider or contractor that describes the purpose and requires the service provider or contractor to both keep that Personal Information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract. These service providers and contractors include our:\\n\\n* backend platform service providers such as for error and crash reporting;\\n* email service providers; \\n* game analytics providers; and \\n* customer support representatives and providers.\\n\\nWe may also disclose your Personal Information:\\n\\n* to our subsidiaries and affiliates;\\n* to our lawyers, consultants, accountants, business advisors, and similar third parties who owe us duties of confidentiality;\\n* to a buyer or other successor in the event of a sale, merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held by us pertaining to the users of the Services is among the assets transferred;\\n* to comply with any court order, law, or legal process, such as responding to a government or regulatory request;\\n* to enforce any contract we may have in effect with you; \\n* if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or others; and \\n* if you have consented to such a disclosure. \\n\\nWe do not sell, rent, or share your Personal Information for cross contextual behavioral or targeted advertising, automated decision-making, or profiling purposes.\\n\\n8. How is my Personal Information protected?\\n\\nOur Retention, Purpose Limitation, and Security Policies\\n\\nWe protect your Personal Information through a combination of collection, security, and retention policies.\\n\\n* Limited retention: We retain each category of Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Information was provided to us or, if longer, to comply with any legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce contracts. For example, we may retain Personal Information collected about you to prevent repeated violations or suspected violations of our Terms of Service if your account has been banned or your access to the Services has been disabled for any reason. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information, the purposes for which we process the Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. For example, subject to the foregoing considerations, it is our policy to delete your Personal Information if we stop operating the Game or feature through which the Personal Information was acquired.\\n\\n* Purpose limitation: We will use your Personal Information only for the Services you choose to access and for the purposes notified to you, unless we otherwise obtain your consent. We limit the collection of Personal Information to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary for those purposes.  \\n\\n* Security measures: We use appropriate measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the volume and nature of Personal Information processed and risk involved, considering the size, scope, and type of our business, and have implemented contractual, technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. As part of our privacy compliance processes, we review these security procedures on an ongoing basis to consider new technology and methods as necessary. However, please understand that our implementation of security measures as described in this Notice does not guarantee the security of your Personal Information. In the event of a security breach, we will notify the proper regulatory authorities and any affected users of the breach within 72 hours after we become aware of the breach.\\n\\nYour Practices and Activities\\n\\nYour practices and activities are likewise very important for the protection of your Personal Information. You can take certain steps to help protect your Personal Information, such as being mindful of what you share publicly in the Game or on the Game Discord channel, including the below. \\n\\n* Do not use your real name when selecting a username.\\n\\n* Do not share your real name or anything private about yourself or anyone else with other users of the Game or Game Discord channel.\\n\\n* Do not pick a password that is easy to guess, and do not share your password.  \\n\\nPlease remember that we have no control over what third parties do with the content of your communications and no responsibility or obligation regarding third parties.\\n\\n9.

Our primary place of business is in the United States. You should understand that we may transfer some or all of your Personal Information to the United States to carry out certain operational and processing needs as described in this Notice.\\n\\nTransfer Mechanisms\\n\\nWhen transferring Personal Information out of foreign territories, we implement technical, organizational, and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Information. We use European Commission approved standard contractual clauses and implement related measures where required by applicable law. Please contact us if you have questions related to the relevant transfer mechanism for your Personal Information.\\n\\n10.

Epileptic Seizure Warning. Please note that certain people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns, even if they have never experienced epileptic symptoms or been previously diagnosed with epilepsy. Such people may have a seizure while watching certain images on screens, including virtual reality headsets, or playing certain video games, including the Game. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness in particular) when exposed to flashing lights, you should consult your doctor prior to playing the Game. Stop playing the Game and consult a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: convulsions; eye or muscle twitching; loss of consciousness or awareness; altered vision, involuntary movements, or disorientation. Another Axiom is not liable for any death, injury, or health complications resulting from any epileptic symptoms or conditions which may occur during or as a result of your use of the Game. To reduce the likelihood of a seizure or epileptic symptoms do not play the Game when tired or need sleep, and take 10- or 15-minute breaks every 30 minutes while playing the Game.\\n2. Motion Sickness. Playing video games (especially virtual reality games), including the Game, may cause motion sickness in some users. If you feel dizzy or nauseous when playing the Game, stop playing and rest. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or engage in other demanding or strenuous activities until you feel better. To limit the risk of motion sickness while playing the Game, do not use the Game when you are tired, need sleep, are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, are hung-over, have digestive problems, are under emotional stress or anxiety, or when suffering from cold, flu, headaches, migraines, earaches, or other health issues which may increase your susceptibility to adverse symptoms.\\n3. Repetitive Motion Injuries and Eyestrain. Playing video games, including the Game, can make your muscles, joints, skin, or eyes hurt. To avoid problems such as tendinitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, skin irritation, or eyestrain: avoid excessive play; take a 10- to 15-minute break every 30 minutes while playing the Game; if your hands, wrists, arms, eyes, or other parts of your body become tired or sore while playing, or if you feel symptoms such as tingling, numbness, burning, or stiffness, stop and rest for several hours before playing again; and if you continue to have any of the above symptoms or other discomfort during or after playing the Game, stop playing and consult a doctor.\\n4. Play Area Precautions. Give yourself plenty of room to play the Game. Always be aware of your surroundings when playing the Game. While playing the Game in virtual reality you will be moving around the play area and using your hands to control gameplay. Make sure the play area is clear of furniture, objects, and other people that could be bumped into during gameplay. Please ensure that you are not near other people, stairs, balconies, windows, walls, furniture, or other objects that may pose a danger to you or could be damaged or injured during or immediately after using the Game. All objects that may pose tripping hazards, could cause injury, or could be damaged as the result of your contact with them while playing the Game should be removed from the play area prior to you playing the Game. A minimum six-feet-by-six-feet unobstructed play area is recommended for safe enjoyment of the Game. Never handle sharp or dangerous objects while playing the Game. Due to the immersive nature of the Game, sound volumes should be kept at low enough levels so that you are able to maintain awareness of your surroundings while playing the Game and so as not to damage your hearing. You should not use the Game if your awareness of your surroundings is impaired by lack of sleep, drugs, alcohol, the effects of a hangover, stress, anxiety, or when suffering from a cold, flu, headaches, migraines, or other illnesses.\\n\\n10.

Epileptic Seizure Warning. Please note that certain people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns, even if they have never experienced epileptic symptoms or been previously diagnosed with epilepsy. Such people may have a seizure while watching certain images on screens, including virtual reality headsets, or playing certain video games, including the Game. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness in particular) when exposed to flashing lights, you should consult your doctor prior to playing the Game. Stop playing the Game and consult a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: convulsions; eye or muscle twitching; loss of consciousness or awareness; altered vision, involuntary movements, or disorientation. Another Axiom is not liable for any death, injury, or health complications resulting from any epileptic symptoms or conditions which may occur during or as a result of your use of the Game. To reduce the likelihood of a seizure or epileptic symptoms do not play the Game when tired or need sleep, and take 10- or 15-minute breaks every 30 minutes while playing the Game.\\n2. Motion Sickness. Playing video games (especially virtual reality games), including the Game, may cause motion sickness in some users. If you feel dizzy or nauseous when playing the Game, stop playing and rest. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or engage in other demanding or strenuous activities until you feel better. To limit the risk of motion sickness while playing the Game, do not use the Game when you are tired, need sleep, are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, are hung-over, have digestive problems, are under emotional stress or anxiety, or when suffering from cold, flu, headaches, migraines, earaches, or other health issues which may increase your susceptibility to adverse symptoms.\\n3. Repetitive Motion Injuries and Eyestrain. Playing video games, including the Game, can make your muscles, joints, skin, or eyes hurt. To avoid problems such as tendinitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, skin irritation, or eyestrain: avoid excessive play; take a 10- to 15-minute break every 30 minutes while playing the Game; if your hands, wrists, arms, eyes, or other parts of your body become tired or sore while playing, or if you feel symptoms such as tingling, numbness, burning, or stiffness, stop and rest for several hours before playing again; and if you continue to have any of the above symptoms or other discomfort during or after playing the Game, stop playing and consult a doctor.\\n4. Play Area Precautions. Give yourself plenty of room to play the Game. Always be aware of your surroundings when playing the Game. While playing the Game in virtual reality you will be moving around the play area and using your hands to control gameplay. Make sure the play area is clear of furniture, objects, and other people that could be bumped into during gameplay. Please ensure that you are not near other people, stairs, balconies, windows, walls, furniture, or other objects that may pose a danger to you or could be damaged or injured during or immediately after using the Game. All objects that may pose tripping hazards, could cause injury, or could be damaged as the result of your contact with them while playing the Game should be removed from the play area prior to you playing the Game. A minimum six-feet-by-six-feet unobstructed play area is recommended for safe enjoyment of the Game. Never handle sharp or dangerous objects while playing the Game. Due to the immersive nature of the Game, sound volumes should be kept at low enough levels so that you are able to maintain awareness of your surroundings while playing the Game and so as not to damage your hearing. You should not use the Game if your awareness of your surroundings is impaired by lack of sleep, drugs, alcohol, the effects of a hangover, stress, anxiety, or when suffering from a cold, flu, headaches, migraines, or other illnesses.\\n\\n10.
